# Halifax: An mbira Mobile First Responsive Web Template
Halifax is a mobile first responsive web template for the mbira platform.

_Currently, all components of the mbira platform (mbira authoring plugin, Halifax web template, and Cusco web template) are in public beta. Any bugs, issues, or questions should be submitted via the appropriate repository on GitHub._

mbira
=====

Currently in development at [MATRIX: The Center for Digital Humanities and Social Sciences](http://matrix.msu.edu), mbira is a platform to build, serve, and manage native and web-based mobile heritage experiences. The goal of the project is to create a constellation of open source tools (existing and purpose built) that will lower the technical bar for individuals, projects, and institutions interested in building rich, engaging, and sustainable place-based and mobile heritage experiences.  

###“Space and Landscape as Museum”###

Based on the metaphor of “space and landscape as museum,” mbira lets users create mobile experience in which locations and areas are organized into curated exhibits displayed within a rich, interactive map interface. Each exhibit location contains information and rich media (video, audio, and imagery) about that location and well as the narrative about the associated scholarly work (excavation, survey, historical and heritage research, etc)

###A Constellation of Open Source Tools###

1. Cloud-based Content Management System: mbira projects are created and managed using a cloud-based digital repository platform or CMS. All content (exhibits, locations, and location content) are added, edited, and updated from within an open source digital repository platform or CMS. When app creators or editors add new project content or edit existing project content, changes dynamically appear in the project’s public native mobile app or mobile website.  This public beta release was developed to function on top of [KORA](http://kora.matrix.msu.edu).  The ultimate goal is to develop mbira for additional digital repository platforms.

2. mbira authoring plugin: the mbira plugin (which is installed on top of the user’s chosen digital repository platform or content management system) is the core authoring environment in mbira’s constellation of open source tools. The mbira authoring plugin facilitates the creation of mobile projects and their associated exhibits, as well as all locations, areas, and explorations (and their associated content).  The mbira authoring plugin also allows creators and editors to manage all social aspects of their mobile applications. In addition, the plugin lets users manage all of the device specific deployments of their mobile heritage experience (iOS, Android, mobile-first responsive web).

3. Mobile Front-end Templates: the mbira constellation of tools includes elegantly designed (and well documented) native mobile (iOS and Android) and mobile-web  templates that individuals, projects, or institutions can use as-is or modify as they see fit. While the templates are designed primarily for those with minimal programming experience, they can also serve as a project jump-start for more seasoned developers. The templates are built specifically to dynamically display content (exhibits, places, spaces, explorations) authored in the mbira plugin. The current version of mbira only only includes two web templates).
